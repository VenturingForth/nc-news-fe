# NC News
## Summary

This repo represents the full amount of work carried out on the front-end of the NC News project created during the Northcoders software engineering bootcamp. You can find the back-end repo here to see the API it was built upon: [NC News Backend](https://github.com/VenturingForth/nc-news-be).

The deployed app can be found here: [Deployed App](https://nc-news-with-jr.netlify.app/)

The task was to essentially build a fully functioning front-end to serve a bulletin-style web API to users that allowed them to:

- view a list of all articles as well as individually.
- view a list of comments associated with an individual article.
- vote on and post comments to articles.
- delete their own comments on articles.
- filter articles by topic and sort them according to date posted, number of votes or number of comments.

Further functionality will be added after completion of the bootcamp and this README will be updated accordingly
